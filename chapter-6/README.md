In this step-by-step tutorial, we will create our platform's APIs by reusing the Kubernetes APIs' power. The first use case where the platform can assist the development teams is by creating new development environments and providing a self-service approach. 

To build this example, we will use Crossplane and `vcluster`, two Open Source projects hosted in the Cloud-Native Computing Foundation. 

## Installation 

To install Crossplane, you need to have a Kubernetes Cluster; you can create one using KinD as we did for you [Chapter 2](../chapter-2/README.md#creating-a-local-cluster-with-kubernetes-kind). 

Then you can install Crossplane and the Crossplane Helm Provider in your cluster as we did in [Chapter 5](https://github.com/salaboy/platforms-on-k8s/tree/main/chapter-5#installing-crossplane)

We will use [`vcluster`](https://www.vcluster.com/) in this tutorial, but there is no need to install anything in our cluster for vcluster to work. We need the `vcluster` CLI to connect to our `vcluster`s you can install it by following the instructions on the official site: [https://www.vcluster.com/docs/getting-started/setup](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/getting-started/setup)


## Defining our Environment API

An environment represents a Kubernetes cluster where the Conference Application will be installed for development. The idea is to provide teams with self-service environments for them to do their work. 

For this tutorial, we will define an Environment API and a Crossplane Composition that uses the Helm Provider to create a new instance of `vcluster`. 

Check the Crossplane Composite Resource Definition (XRD) for our [Environments here](resources/env-resource-definition.yaml) and the Crossplane [Composition here](resources/composition-devenv.yaml). This resource configures the provisioning of a new `vcluster` using the Crossplane Helm Provider, [check this configuration here](https://github.com/salaboy/platforms-on-k8s/blob/main/chapter-6/resources/composition-devenv.yaml#L24). When a new `vcluster` is created then the composition install our Conference Application into it, once again using the Crossplane Helm Provider, but this time configured [pointing to the just created `vcluster` APIs](https://github.com/salaboy/platforms-on-k8s/blob/main/chapter-6/resources/composition-devenv.yaml#L87), you can [check this here](https://github.com/salaboy/platforms-on-k8s/blob/main/chapter-6/resources/composition-devenv.yaml#L117).

Let's install both XRD by running: 

```shell
kubectl apply -f resources/definitions
```

Now that the XRD is defined, let's install the Composition by running:

```shell
kubectl apply -f resources/compositions
```

You should see: 

```shell
composition.apiextensions.crossplane.io/dev.env.salaboy.com created
compositeresourcedefinition.apiextensions.crossplane.io/environments.salaboy.com created
```

With the Environment resource and the Crossplane Composition using `vcluster` our teams can now request their Environments on demand. 


## Requesting a new Environment

To request a new Environment, teams can create new environment resources like this one: 

```yaml
apiVersion: salaboy.com/v1alpha1
kind: Environment
metadata:
  name: team-a-dev-env
spec:
  compositionSelector:
    matchLabels:
      type: development
  parameters: 
    installInfra: true
    
```

Once sent to the cluster, the Crossplane Composition will kick in and create a new `vcluster` with an instance of the Conference Application inside. 

```shell
kubectl apply -f team-a-dev-env.yaml
```
You should see: 

```shell
environment.salaboy.com/team-a-dev-env created
```

You can always check the state of your Environments by running: 

```shell
> kubectl get env
NAME             CONNECT-TO             TYPE          INFRA   DEBUG   SYNCED   READY   CONNECTION-SECRET   AGE
team-a-dev-env   team-a-dev-env-jp7j4   development   true    true    True     False   team-a-dev-env      1s

```

You can check that Crossplane is creating and managing resources related to the composition by running: 

```shell
> kubectl get managed
NAME                            CHART            VERSION          SYNCED   READY   STATE      REVISION   DESCRIPTION        AGE
team-a-dev-env-jp7j4-8lbtj      conference-app   v1.0.0           True     True    deployed   1          Install complete   57s
team-a-dev-env-jp7j4-vcluster   vcluster         0.15.0-alpha.0   True     True    deployed   1          Install complete   57s
```

These managed resources are no other than Helm Releases being created:

```shell
kubectl get releases
NAME                            CHART            VERSION          SYNCED   READY   STATE      REVISION   DESCRIPTION        AGE
team-a-dev-env-jp7j4-8lbtj      conference-app   v1.0.0           True     True    deployed   1          Install complete   45s
team-a-dev-env-jp7j4-vcluster   vcluster         0.15.0-alpha.0   True     True    deployed   1          Install complete   45s
```


Then we can connect to the provisioned environment by running (use the CONNECT-TO column for the vcluster name): 
```shell
vcluster connect team-a-dev-env-jp7j4 --server https://localhost:8443 -- zsh
```

Once you are connected to the `vcluster` you are in a different Kubernetes Cluster, so if you list all the available namespaces, you should see: 

```shell
kubectl get ns
NAME              STATUS   AGE
default           Active   64s
kube-system       Active   64s
kube-public       Active   64s
kube-node-lease   Active   64s
```

As you can see, Crossplane is not installed here. But if you list all the pods in this cluster, you should see all the application pods running: 

```shell
NAME                                                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
conference-app-kafka-0                                            1/1     Running   0             103s
conference-app-postgresql-0                                       1/1     Running   0             103s
conference-app-c4p-service-deployment-57d4ddcd68-45f6h            1/1     Running   2 (99s ago)   104s
conference-app-agenda-service-deployment-9bf7946c9-mmx8h          1/1     Running   2 (98s ago)   104s
conference-app-redis-master-0                                     1/1     Running   0             103s
conference-app-frontend-deployment-c8c64c54d-lntnw                1/1     Running   2 (98s ago)   104s
conference-app-notifications-service-deployment-64ff7bcdf8nbvhl   1/1     Running   3 (80s ago)   104s
```

You can also do port-forwarding to this cluster, to access the application using:
```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/frontend 8080:80
```
Now your application is available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)


You can exit the `vcluster` context by typing `exit` in the terminal.


## Simplifying our platform surface

We can go one step further to simplify the interaction with the platform APIs, preventing teams from connecting to the Platform Cluster and removing the need for having access to the Kubernetes APIs. 

In this short section, we deploy an Admin User Interface that allows teams to request new environments using a website, or a set of simplified REST APIs. 

Before installing the Admin User Interface, you need to make sure that you are not inside a `vcluster` session. (You can exit the `vcluster` context by typing `exit` in the terminal). Check that you have the `crossplane-system` namespaces in the current cluster where you are connected. 

You can install this Admin User Interface using Helm:

```shell
helm install admin oci://docker.io/salaboy/conference-admin --version v1.0.0
```

Once installed you can port-forward to the Admin UI by running: 

```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/admin 8081:80
```

Now you can create and check your environments using a simple interface at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081). If you wait for the environment to be ready, you will get the `vcluster` command to use to connect to the environment.

![imgs/admin-ui.png](imgs/admin-ui.png)

By using this simple interface, development teams will not need to access the Kubernetes APIs from the cluster which has all the platform tools (Crossplane and Argo CD for example) directly.

Besides the User interface, the Platform Admin application offers you a simplified set of REST endpoints where you have full flexibility to define how the resources look like instead of following the Kubernetes Resource Model. For example, instead of having a Kubernetes Resource with all the metadata needed by the Kubernetes API, we can use the following JSON payload to create a new Environment: 

```json
{
    "name": "team-curl-dev-env",
    "parameters":{
        "type": "development",
        "installInfra": true,
        "frontend":{
            "debug": true
        }
    }
}
```

You can create this environment by running:

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @team-a-dev-env-simple.json http://localhost:8081/api/environments/
```

Then list all the environments with: 
```shell
curl localhost:8081/api/environments/
```

Or delete one environment running: 

```shell
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8081/api/environments/team-curl-dev-env
```

This application serves as a facade between Kubernetes and the outside world. Depending on your organization's needs, you might want to have these abstractions (APIs) early on, so the platform team can pivot on their tooling and workflow decisions under the covers.


## Clean up

If you want to get rid of the KinD Cluster created for these tutorials, you can run:

```shell
kind delete clusters dev
```


## Next Steps

Can you extend the Admin User Interface to create Databases and Message Brokers like we did in Chapter 5? What would it take? Understanding where the changes need to be made will give you hands-on experience in developing components that interact with the Kubernetes APIs and provide simplified interfaces for consumers.

Can you create your own compositions to use Real Clusters instead of `vcluster`? For which kind of scenario would you use a real Cluster and when a `vcluster`?

What extra steps would you need to do to run this in a real Kubernetes Cluster instead of running this on Kubernetes KinD? 



## Sum up and Contribute

In this tutorial, we have built a new Platform API reusing the Kubernetes Resource model to provision on-demand development environments. On top of that with the Platform Admin application we have created a simplified layer to expose the same capabilities without pushing teams to learn about how Kubernetes works or the underlying details, projects, and technologies that we have used to build our Platform. 

By relying on contracts (for this example the Environment resource definition), the platform team has the flexibility to change the mechanisms used to provision environments depending on their requirements and available tools.
